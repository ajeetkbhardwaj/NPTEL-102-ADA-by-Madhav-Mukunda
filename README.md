# Design and Analysis of Algorithms by Mukunda Madhavan

* At the time of Design and Analysis of Algorithms, we needed to keep in mind is that Algorithm is correct and it's doing their job for wich i constructed. Analysis deals with Strategies for proving correctness of Algorithms
* *Efficiency of Algorithms* means how much time and storage required for the execution and storage of algorithms.

  * *Asymptotic Complexity* used to measure the running time of and algorithms.It also used as a way of comparing two different algorithms wich operates on same input and produces same output
    * *Big O notation* used in order to smoothen out some algorithms and group them into large chunks, which are equivalent.
* The art of problem solving in any domain(Algorithms) is to model the problem at suitable level of details. For most of Algorithms, we needed to find a mathematical model e.g. Graphs i.e To find a way of representing the concepts of models into algorithms, for representing these algorithms we needed appropriate Data Structures and to solve the problem we needed to break the problem into smaller subproblems.
* We needed to make a strategies to decompose the problem into subproblems and see how to put them togather to solve the original problems. for this many generic techniques has been developed to solve the large number of problems.

  * **Divide and Conquire Techniques** : It break the problem into individual components which don't overlaps with each other and then combine these solutions in order to get the solution of overall problems.
* We needed to make strategies to looks at the local level(state) of the problems and choose and optimal path and arrives at  the final solution without having a look at all possibilities.

  * **Greedy Techniques** : If it exits for any algorithms then that will be more efficient than other type of algorithms.else,
  * **The Concepts of Dynamic Programming** :  we needed a systematic way of exploring all possibilities and choosing the best one. In this process we discard overlapping problems and make sure that we don't waste full recomputed things
